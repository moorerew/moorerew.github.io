## This was a standard GitHub page design

I am slowly trying to edit the text to make it my own. 

This is a slow process as I learn how to use GitHub and therefore how to make and commit changes and how to use branches to make changes. 

### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/moorerew/moorerew.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
